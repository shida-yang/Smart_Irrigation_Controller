# Monochrome pixel weather icons

This is a set of 32x32 and 16x16 pixels monochrome weather icons that I
hand-drawn for anyone to use.  The two size sets contain the same icons.

## Why

I was looking for weather icons to use on a low resolution monocrhome display
for a small project and I didn't find any free set of monochrome small icons,
so I made them myself.
